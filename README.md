## Prerequisites

- To run Swirl in Docker, you must have the latest [Docker app](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for MacOS, Linux, or Windows installed and running locally. You can also watch the [**video tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OogRYkfSki8) to get started.

- Windows users must also install and configure either the WSL 2 or the Hyper-V backend, as outlined in the  [System Requirements for installing Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#system-requirements).

## Start Swirl in Docker

> **Warning**
> Make sure the Docker app is running before proceeding!

- Download the YAML file: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swirlai/swirl-search/main/docker-compose.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swirlai/swirl-search/main/docker-compose.yaml)

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swirlai/swirl-search/main/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
```

- *Optional*: To enable Swirl's Real-Time Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in Docker, run the following commands from the Console using a valid OpenAI API key:
  
``` shell
export MSAL_CB_PORT=8000
export MSAL_HOST=localhost
export OPENAI_API_KEY=‘<your-OpenAI-API-key>’
```

:key: Check out [OpenAI's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/nafDyRsVnXU?si=YpvyaRvhX65vtBrb) if you don't have an OpenAI API Key.

- In MacOS or Linux, run the following command from the Console:

```bash
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```
